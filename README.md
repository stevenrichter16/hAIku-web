# hAIku-web
A ReactJS version of the original hAIku app I built with React Native

https://haiku-site.web.app/

NOTE: If you install this app in your environment it will not work since I had to remove sensitive information like API keys and configuration details.

**Motivation**:

The motivation for the hAIku web app (hAIku web) came after developing the hAIku React Native app. I wanted to develop a web version of the app, so I began development using ReactJS.

**Goal**:

The goal of the hAIku web is to develop a web version of hAIku in order to reach a larger user base.

**Current State of the App**:

hAIku web is in the early stages of development. Currently the app has a functioning poem generator and a page that displays the saved poems. As of now there is no authentication functionality, so the poem generator is unable to be used by the general public. The saved poems are able to be viewed both as a grid and as a table, and a filter option is available so users can filter poems by poem topic. However, despite these features, there is still lots of functionality and styling to add.


**Languages and Technologies**:

The bulk of the code is written in ReactJS and styled with Material UI. 

Database interaction is done through Google Firestore.

API interaction is done through axios.

State management is done through Redux Toolkit.


**Compliance with OpenAI's Safety Guidlines**:

Since hAIku web is in the early stages of development it does not adhere to OpenAI's safetly guidlines yet. Once the poem generator feature is open to the public I will add code to make the app comply with OpenAI's safety guidlines.
